#Project Submission

In this project, you'll use both HTML and CSS to make a professional-looking web page! Be sure to look through the notes you've taken to make sure you understand the fundamental HTML and CSS concepts you've learned throughout the course so far. And remember, you can make this project on any topic you'd like!

##Code Review

Your reviewer will look at the code you've written and provide feedback on:

Use of Syntax: All of your HTML and CSS should be properly formatted and should pass HTML validation and CSS validation tests.

IMPORTANT: Please read the Instructor Notes below for further instructions on HTML validation.

Use of Logical HTML Structure: Content that is logically related should be grouped together within a container element (like a <div> or <span>). Additionally, all tags should be used for their semantic purpose (ex: don't use a <p> tag to make a headline).
Use of HTML Classes and CSS Styling: There shouldn't be any unnecessary repetition in your CSS code. Similar HTML elements should have the same class name.

IMPORTANT: You MUST include a CSS file in your project submission. We want you to practice linking CSS in your HTML. Simply using <style> tags is not sufficient.

Use of Tags: Page uses tags correctly, e.g.<p> for paragraphs, <h1> for main heading, and so on.
Content Display: Page displays at least one image and some text.

We recommend that you look over the project rubric to make sure your project meets requirements.
